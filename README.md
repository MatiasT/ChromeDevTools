# ChromeDevTools
A simplified c# access to chrome dev tools, wrapping the library developed by BaristaLab (https://github.com/BaristaLabs/chrome-dev-tools-runtime)


What they have implemented exceeds my needs, and is somewhat unconfortable to use, so this aims to provide a simpler interface to access the specific features i need for another project.
